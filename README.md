There comes a time in any aspiring data scientists life when he/she feels called to try to use data science to beat the market and become loaded.

Despite my firm beleif in the strong effecient market hypothesis, my time has come.

Because I fear bankrupcy I will not be doing any shorts or calls, just going to try to build an algorithm that tells me if I should hold or sell.

I doubt anyone will read this, but if you are reading this, you've probably been in my shoes at some point. How did your attempt go?
