# There comes a time in any aspiring data scientists life when he/she feels called to try to use data science to beat the market and become loaded.

Despite my __firm__ beleif in the strong effecient market hypothesis, my time has come.

Because I fear bankrupcy I will not be doing any shorts or calls, just going to try to build an algorithm that tells me if I should hold or sell.

Im planning to start with time series forecasting, and see how accurate I can get there. At some point I'll probably move to a classification algorithm to classify a stock on a day as a hold or a sell.

I doubt anyone will read this, but if you are reading this, you've probably been in my shoes at some point. How did your attempt go?
